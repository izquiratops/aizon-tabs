This project uses Vite as the development tooling, replacing the deprected react-scripts I initialy found.

Node 20 is a new requirement, you must switch to that version in order to run the project.

Install dependencies with your package manager of choice.
After a successful install you're ready to go running the NPM command 'start'.

``` shell
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Run dev build in localhost
yarn start
```

Tests and some Stories for Storybook were added for the component Tabs as well.

``` shell
# Run test batch for Tabs
yarn test
# Run storybook in localhost
yarn storybook
```
