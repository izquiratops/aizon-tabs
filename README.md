This project uses Vite as the development tooling, replacing the deprected react-scripts I initialy found.
Node 20 is a prerequisite for running the project.

Install dependencies with your package manager of choice.
After a successful install you're ready to go running the NPM command 'start'.

```shell
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run dev build in localhost
yarn start
```

Tests and some Stories for [Storybook](https://izquiratops.github.io/aizon-tabs/) were added for the component Tabs as well.

```shell
# Run test batch for Tabs
yarn test

# Run storybook in localhost
yarn storybook
```
